# Activity

## To Do List

- [ ] Some activity diagrams don't start from the user side, and end at user side (some end at system, some end at database), this includes
  - All of the generic use cases (need to fix to start with "user get list \_\_")
- [ ] All the diagrams have the third swimlane for database, need to remove that and only have two swimlanes (system and actor)

## Example

- This is from another project, just for reference for syntax
- Do not read the `/tms` folder
